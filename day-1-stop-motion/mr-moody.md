# Mr. Moody

Bring to life a character out of clay!

## Objective

Understand how stop motion works and use elements of stop motion to have a clay character exhibit emotion.

## Your Challenge

## Part I: Hi!

1. Create a character with at least one hand or arm capable of waving out of clay.
2. Using your picture taking device, take pictures of your clay character waving. Make sure to take lots of pictures at every increment. Position your clay character, then take a picture. Change the position slightly, then take another picture...etc.
3. Make your clay character wave enthusiastically! The key is making strategic incremental poses and taking pictures often!
4. Upload your pictures to Adobe Premiere Pro and set it up for stop motion by doing the following.
  * Select all of your images and right click on them.
  * Select ```Speed/Duration``` and set the Duration to: 00:00:00:02. Press OK.
  * Double click on one image so that it appears at the top left screen.
  * Drag the image to the sequence editor in the lower right screen.
  * Highlight the rest of your images and drag them to the sequence editor.
  * Play the stop motion by hitting the play button in the right upper corner screen.
5. If it's not what you expected, try again! Take more pictures or whiteboard it to get a better idea of what positions you want.

## Part II: In the Mood

1. Select a secret mood from the box of moods. Don't tell anyone what mood you have!
2. Have your character exhibit that mood through its actions. Make strategic positions. Remember characters that you see in movies or television and see if you can mimic how they are able to show their emotions.
3. Take incremental pictures to make a stop motion.
4. Upload your pictures to Adobe Premiere Pro and make your stop motion video.
5. Look through the different effects and see if you can add any that would help convey your mood.
