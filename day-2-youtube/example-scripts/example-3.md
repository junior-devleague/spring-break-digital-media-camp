Benji: How do you get viewers and subscribers when you're just starting out or you just started your channel? We are gonna talk about that RIGHT NOW.

Sean: Hey what's up Sean here.

Benji: Benji

Sean: And this is Video Influencers helping you crush it with YouTube and online video and questions have been coming from you guys, we appreciate it so much. One of these questions is how to get subscribers and views when you're literally starting from scratch.
---
Benji: Yeah, probably one of the most asked questions from the viewers of this channel. And there's a million things you can do. But, the number one thing I think you can do and it goes without saying: great content. Great videos. No more are the days where you know, hopefully, you can get 1080, or 720 at least, non hasty videos. HD is a standard. But even beyond that. Make sure that content that you're giving out, whether its comedy, whether its cooking, whether its beauty, its entertaining, its informative, educational, or its just, it gives value. Something of value okay. It's gotta be something that people wanna watch and they benefit from. So content is king. What are your thoughts on that?
---
Sean: You know, I would totally agree. That is the big question. Is, is your content good enough  to get views and subscribers. Now, if you have great content but not good marketing, then maybe no one is seeing it. But usually, good content is gonna gradually pick up momentum and catch speed because it's good. And here's the thing though with good content. If you're content isn't good enough, I think we need to have good self awareness. Maybe we're still learning. And here's the good thing though. Maybe your content isn't good enough yet, don't worry about it. I encourage you, post consistently, inobscurely, to level up your content for popularity.
---
Benji: Practice makes perfect, and you are gonna build your experience so that when the time comes, when you do get noticed, you hit it hard. So I agree with you, even though I did say content is king, you want high quality, you wanna make sure its valuable, well if you aren't used to being in front of the camera, you gotta get there.
---
Sean: Yep. And so, why not good? You might go 52 weeks, you might go 104 weeks, 2 years, post a video a week. Those first 2 years might not be that great. But after that, all of a sudden, its like you might have an "overnight success". IT wasn't overnight. You've been crushing it, learning, growing your content, and so then you're ready. To. Launch. So that's kinda the first thing, and my second thing, as far as how to get noticed when you're just starting out is something we talk about a lot. (Looks at Benji) And that is to rank videos. And that people should strategically be saying for the channel that I'm on, I want to show up on the other side of Serge for my niche, so if I mean, it would be hard to rank. But if its funny animal videos, you want to start ranking some videos for funny, cat videos. Now here's the thing, you're probably not gonna get that term. This is what you do, if you happen to be making funny cat videos . Funny Siamese cat video - that title is actually, probably still targetable. One of your videos for your cooking channel- lots of your videos rank, but they rank around terms - here are some of the reasons why they rank - not just cuz he's got subscribers, not just cuz of the quality of the content or anything - or - those things - kind of a times cuz there's nobody else in that niche yet.

Benji: Mhm. Exactly,
