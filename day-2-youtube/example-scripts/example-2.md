  * Benji: So today's video comes from Jackie Lee from the BI community and Jackie asked what are the top 10 YouTube mistakes beginners make.
---
  * Sean: Mistake number 1 is looking into the viewfinder instead of the lens so especially if you have a camera with a front-facing screen it could be tempting to just stare at yourself whether you're shooting in your bedroom or even you're out vlogging, but you don't want to do that what you want to do is look directly into the lens because that way you'll be actually making really eye contact with viewers.
---
  * Benji: Yeah in a real example of this is like, imagine you're talking to your friend but they're looking at your forehead. How awkward that would be. And that translates to video as well so that's why we always tell people, especially beginners to look at the lens.
---
  * Sean: Mistake number 2 is spamming other people's YouTube comments now I know you've probably seen this before and this is where people may say sub for sub, they may really heavily promote their YouTube channel on somebody else's channel.
---
  * Benji: And the difference between spamming and what we suggest which is engagement is you have conversations with people right, you vibe with people, you watch other people's videos and you leave comments right? And you let them discover your stuff. So rather than asking for the sub or visiting their channel, you add value by engaging with their content.
---
  * Sean: Mistake number 3 is bad or confusing YouTube titles.
---
  * Benji: And what we see a lot of people doing is like what other youtubers are doing especially really famous ones. And one of the number one things we see as a mistake beginners Youtubers make is the fact that they're using like, their channel name as a first thing in the title right- Or they're saying today's vlog, or vlog 182. Especially if you're a beginner you need to be having searchable content be part of that first part of the title.
---
  * Sean: Yeah it's kinda like you don't want to use "insider" language because there isn't a bunch of insiders yet and you don't wanna have the title only make sense to YOU and maybe a few friends or subscribers. It should be very focused on potential audience members that can discover your content.
---
  * Benji: Mistake number 4 being inconsistent. It is so important to always show up at least once a week to your community you know, there's a lot of people that get all pumped up raw raw and they do ten videos in a month and then they don't show up for another six months. It's actually better to post up one video for ten weeks, then doing all 10 in one week and never showing up again.
---
  * Sean: Absolutely. Consistency is king on youtube and one pro tip here is taking advantage of YouTube live in case you don't have a weekly video to upload. Sometimes Benji and I will make sure that we get a google hangout in together a youtube live stream on a Saturday just to make sure that we always upload at least once a week.
