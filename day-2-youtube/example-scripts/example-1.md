  * Sean: So how do you come up with creative names for your YT channel, for your website, things like that? - we are going to talk about it in THIS video.
---
  * Benji: Bam
---
  * Benji: Welcome to Video Influencers, I am Benji. (points to Sean)
---
  * Sean: Sean
---
  * Benji: And we are here to teach you about video - how to utilize video whether its on YouTube, Twitter, FB, Meerkat now so or Snapchat.. and today we are going to be talking about how to deal with the challenge of finding a name for your YouTube channel. Now this is just a challenge for really any platform so it's not just isolated to YouTube but today specifically we are going to be talking about your YouTube channel - what would be the first thing you'd suggest when it comes to your YT channel name?
---
  * Sean: Well the first thing I think about Benji is that you wanna think about all of your platforms because and this will apply to anything so if you are looking for a website name or a YouTube channel name I would start thinking, ok, I have an idea, but now I need to check to see if it's available on social media, maybe you know, the main platforms that I want to use, and so the first thing that I would say is to start with a focusâ€¦ like what's the focus of your channel gonna be. Now here's the really easy one - your name.
---
  * Benji: Yeah. Totally.
---
  * Sean: If you're not John Smith, that's taken. You can have seancannell.com nobody else was competing for that and you could ask yourself is your channel just gonna be your name? But if it's not going to be your name you think about what is your focus. And so you can think about if its going to be a cooking channel, what would you do if you were gonna start off trying to create a new YT channel in the cooking space.
---
  * Benji: Yeah I mean, it just all depends on where you want to bring your content you know, do you want to be specific niche like super bowl food recipes or do you want to be kinda more generic you just wanna do whatever recipe you think of right? So those are the things I'd consider when coming up with my name for you know, Youtube channels.
---
  * Sean: Yeah lets think even cooking I think the more focused you are the better, because it will make you limited but it's also good so if you had a cooking channel you could do, if you called it "Asian cooking with some body" or you just said "Asian cooking" then that's going to be very focused but still specific and people are gonna know if they wanna buy into that. Cooking in general might be a little too broad -
---
  * Benji: OH yeah, totally.
---
  * Sean: Yeah so yeah. Having a focus is huge so then the second think you want to do is you want to look to see if that name is available and so I like to go to like godaddy.com and not only check your YouTube name to see if its available on YT but check on the social platforms to see if it's available and one of the way to test that is literally just type in youtube.com/ what you want to call your channel but then also do that on twitter and then even go to the URL and start looking for your name as well.
---
  * Benji: You know its definitely worth the effort  to find a good name for your channel for your brand, because big companies literally spend tens of thousands of dollars trying to get the website name that they want to get for whatever company and like I think it's probably a well known story about the apple.com somebody owned apple.com and whoever that was made a lot of money right? Yeah so people do want their name so its you as a beginning YT channel you definitely want to consider that.
