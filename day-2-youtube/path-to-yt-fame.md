# On Your Way to Youtube Stardom

You are on your way to becoming a YouTube star!

## Objective

Understand how to convey messages through video using scripts, appropriate emphasis, and energy.

## Your Challenge

## Part I: Emulating The Pros

1. Partner Up.
2. Obtain a professional YouTube script from the instructors. This script is made and published in a popular video on YouTube.
3. With your partner, read through the script, making sure to emphasize certain words indicated in the script.
4. Find a spot to record a video.
5. Tape the script somewhere so you can see it and film you and your partner reading the script. Use gestures and find a good place to film!
6. Watch the video that you produced. Compare it to the actual video on YouTube, and see how they were able to convey the same message in a different way.

## Part II: Interesting Scripts

1. With your partner (or a different partner), obtain a different script from your instructors.
2. This script isn't a professional one, so you can edit areas that you think are awkward and make it your own.
3. Find a spot to record a video when you're ready.
4. Upload the video to Adobe Premiere Pro and edit. Create a title screen, add effects, color corrections, and more!
