1. Import a reference image and resize it to fit the white background. (Click on the 1st arrow indicated below and drag the corners of the image to resize).

5. Click and drag along the outline of your main image body. When you drag along a point, you can control a Bezier handle which will let you curve things easily. Make sure you have a black stroke of about 5 pts to see the outline.

7. Create text by selecting the text icon and dragging it on your image. Change the font and size of font. It's nice to have a "Handwritten" type of font so when we distort it, it looks like you've drawn it on paper.
