# Coloring Context

Use color schemes, shapes, and concepts learned earlier in the week to create a "room" of sorts.

## Objective

Understand how colors can create mood and context in tandem with shapes and composition.

## Your Challenge

1. Obtain a random color strip from the instructor.
2. Open up Illustrator.
3. Play around with the various tools to draw and edit.
4. Fill your shapes with colors from your color scheme strip.
5. Construct a version of your "room". It can gradually start to change into something more interesting as you go.
